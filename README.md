## Update repo url locally

Not technically necessary, but good practice.

To point your local git repo to the new url, run:
```shell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/olinlibrary/soundscope.git
```

You can use `git remote -v` to verify that your repo now points to https://github.com/olinlibrary/soundscope.git for fetch and push.
